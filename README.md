# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

After completing an initial successful analysis as a data analyst for Pyber, a Python-based ride sharing app, upper management has assigned a new task to further understand their service differences by city type. In this analysis, the final deliverables will be a summary displaying the ride sharing data grouped by city type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural), a graph summarizing the total fares by city type at a weekly cadence, and three recommendations for business implementation based on the narrative of the data results. 

## Analysis Results 

The results of the analysis yielded a very stark story in regards to the concentration of Pyber’s current services within urban areas. From the city type summary below, the percentage of urban rides out of total rides can be calculated to be 68%. Similarly, urban fares collected made up 63% of all total fares collected from January to April in 2019. Lastly, while urban rides had the greatest total amount of rides and total fares, it actually had both the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver. This makes intuitive sense as a ride-sharing service in an urban area will most likely cover less distance than a service in a rural or suburban area.

The weekly summary by city type below also corroborates the findings discussed previously. In every week, urban rides collected the greatest number of fares, with suburban rides second and rural rides last. To further expand on non-urban rides, suburban rides on average comprised 30% of all weekly total fares and rural comprised 10%. In every week, suburban rides comprised no more than 36% of all total fares and rural rides comprised no more than 21%.

The weekly summary by city type can also be transformed to a line chart to give a more visual, high-level representation of the data. The line chart is below:

These two summaries and the visualization point to a result that should come as no surprise: the bulk of Pyber’s services and gross revenue is concentrated with urban areas. To address these disparities among city types, three business recommendations for future implementation will be presented to upper management.

## Analysis Results Summary

Before commencing with the business recommendations, it is imperative to note that the three weeks with the highest number of total fares (2-24, 4-7, and 4-28) all had urban rides comprised less than its total average of 63% of total fares. The urban percentage of total fares for these three weeks were 51%, 61%, 59%. This means that as Pyber actually diversifies its services to non-urban areas, its gross revenue actually increases. As such, upper management should not worry about addressing service disparities between city types to adversely impact revenue. In fact, addressing such disparities will actually increase revenue. Accordingly, the three business recommendations for upper management to consider are as follows:

•	Attempt to target suburban fares to comprise a weekly percentage of 32% of all total fares. This is the average of suburban percentage out of all fares for the weeks of 2-24,4-7, and 4-28. The current suburban percentage of out all fares from January to April in 2019 is 30%. This is a 2% target increase.

•	Attempt to target rural fares to comprise a weekly percentage of 16% of all total fares. This is the average of rural percentage out of all fares for the weeks of 2-24,4-7, and 4-28. The current rural percentage of out all fares from January to April in 2019 is 10%. This is a 6% target increase.

•	 Attempt to target urban fares to comprise a weekly percentage of 59% of all total fares. This is the average of urban percentage out of all fares for the weeks of 2-24,4-7, and 4-28. The current urban percentage of out all fares from January to April in 2019 is 63%. This is a 4% target decrease.

With these three business recommendations, Pyber would not only expand their service market to non-urban areas but also see gross revenue increase concurrently.
