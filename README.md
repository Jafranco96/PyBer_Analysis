# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

After completing an initial successful analysis as a data analyst for Pyber, a Python-based ride sharing app, upper management has assigned a new task to further understand their service differences by city type. In this analysis, the final deliverables will be a summary displaying the ride sharing data grouped by city type (Rural, Suburban, or Rural), a graph summarizing the total fares by city type at a weekly cadence, and three recommendations for business implementation based on the narrative of the data results. 

## Analysis Results 

The results of the analysis yielded a very stark story in regards to the concentration of Pyber’s current services within urban areas. From the city type summary below, the percentage of urban rides out of total rides can be calculated to be 68%. Similarly, urban fares collected made up 63% of all total fares collected from January to April in 2019. Lastly, while urban rides had the greatest total amount of rides and total fares, it actually had both the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver. This makes intuitive sense as a ride-sharing service in an urban area will most likely cover less distance than a service in a rural or suburban area.

The weekly summary by city type below also corroborates the findings discussed previously. In every week, urban rides collected the greatest number of fares, with suburban rides second and rural rides last. To further expand on non-urban rides, suburban rides on average comprised 30% of all weekly total fares and rural comprised 10%. In every week, suburban rides comprised no more than 36% of all total fares and rural rides comprised no more than 21%.

The weekly summary by city type can also be transformed to a line chart to give a more visual, high-level representation of the data. The line chart is below:

These two summaries and the visuazaltion point to a result that should come as no surprise: the bulk of Pyber’s services and gross revenue is concentrated with urban areas. To address these disparities among city types, three business recommendations for future implementation will be presented to upper management
