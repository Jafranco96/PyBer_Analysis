# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

After completing an initial successful analysis as a data analyst for Pyber, a Python-based ride sharing app, upper management has assigned a new task to further understand their service differences by city type. In this analysis, the final deliverables will be a summary displaying the ride sharing data grouped by city type (Rural, Suburban, or Rural), a graph summarizing the total fares by city type at a weekly cadence, and three recommendations for business implementation based on the narrative of the data results.
